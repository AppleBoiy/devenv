The `bits-stdc-.h-for-mac` extension enables macOS users to utilize the `bits/stdc++` header, originally a GNU GCC extension, with the clang compiler commonly used on macOS systems. This repository provides the necessary adaptation to make the `bits/stdc++` features compatible with clang.

## Usage

Follow these steps to integrate the `bits-stdc-.h-for-mac` extension into your C++ projects:

1. **Download the Extension**: Download the `stdc++.h` header file from the [repository](https://github.com/tekfyl/bits-stdc-.h-for-mac). This header file is essential for adapting the `bits/stdc++` extension to macOS clang.

2. **Integration**:
   - Create a new directory named `bits` within your project's include directory if it does not already exist.
   - Copy the downloaded `stdc++.h` header file into the `bits` directory.

3. **Include the Extension**: In your C++ source code, include the extension header in the following manner:
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   ```

4. **Usage**: You can now use the `bits/stdc++` features as you would on a GNU GCC environment. Note that the actual functionality might slightly differ due to the adaptation to the clang compiler.
