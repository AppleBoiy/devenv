<!-- ABOUT THE REPOSITORY -->
## About the Repository
This repository contains my personal dot files for configuring my development environment. It includes configuration files for various tools and applications, such as Neovim, shell profiles (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`), and other files related to my development setup. These dot files are highly customizable and tailored to my specific needs and preferences.


<!-- DOT FILES -->
## Dot Files
The dot files in this repository are organized as follows:

- `nvim/`: Configuration files for Neovim editor.
- `shell/`: Shell profile configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).
- `dev-environment/`: Configuration files related to my development environment setup.
- Other relevant dot files.



<!-- DEPENDENCIES -->
