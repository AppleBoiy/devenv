## About the Repository

This is where I keep all the special settings and preferences for my coding environment. It's like my digital toolbox! Inside, you'll find settings for tools like Neovim, the shell (like `.bashrc` and `.zshrc`), and other files that make my development setup work just right. These settings are made to fit my needs and how I like to work.
